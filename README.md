# uGLyRenderer
uGLyRenderer is a 3d model renderer for viewing various 3d models on your screen. It uses my [uGLy engine](https://github.com/gkarpa/uGLyEngine) for the scene setup and manipulation, [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) for the file loading and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) as its window & input library.

It features an orbit camera that you can manipulate with your mouse, along with a custom FoV. The application also setups a fixed point light (represented with an icosahedron) that shades the scene using Blinn-Phong lighting shaders.

You can see some screenshots from it in action below.
